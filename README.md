## Projects

1. [Flow Performance Analysis](./Flow%20Performance%20Investigation/FlowPerformance.md)
    - Recently whislt working on a project I was given the task of investigating why the response times of a custom rest endpoint were so slow (30s+) as the process on the front end was user facing and therefore this was far too long to await a response. I have attached here a short section of the performance analysis work carried out that was presented to the team during the explaination of potential approaches to reduce the response time.

2. [Work History input for customer community](./Community%20Date%20range%20LWC/CommunityLWC.md)
    - For a recruiting client recently I was asked to help improve the record capture within their customer community to ensure that when users work history could be captured more easily as previously this was carried out in a screen flow but users were struggling with data entry taking up staff members time while they had to capture and input this data over the phone.
